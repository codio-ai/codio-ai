## Introduction

Codio AI is an advanced artificial intelligence assistant designed to revolutionize the development process. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies, Codio empowers developers to code smarter, faster, and more efficiently. With its chat-based interface and powerful code generation capabilities, Codio is set to transform the way developers approach their projects.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Chat Interface
Codio begins with an intuitive chat-based interface where users can input prompts, attach files, and receive intelligent responses in the form of text, code, or specialized Blocks.

### 2. Blocks
Blocks are unique content types that unlock new functionality in Codio:

#### UI Generation Block
- Generates client-side UI components in React, Vue, Svelte, and HTML with CSS
- Supports copying, downloading, and direct installation of generated code
- Includes client-side JavaScript capabilities and integration with third-party libraries

#### Code Execution Block
- Allows writing and execution of simple JavaScript code
- Useful for testing functions in isolation
- Supports writing test cases to ensure code quality

### 3. Projects
- Organize chats into groups for better management
- Bring your own data sources to Codio
- Upload Sources for Codio to access during chats
- Add custom instructions to tailor Codio's responses

### 4. Advanced AI Models
Codio is built on a powerful combination of AI models:
- Ollama: Provides the foundation for running large language models locally
- Qwen: Enhances natural language understanding and generation
- Llama 3.1: Powers advanced reasoning and code generation capabilities

## Technology Stack

Codio leverages a state-of-the-art technology stack to provide unparalleled coding assistance:

- **Ollama**: Enables local execution of large language models
- **Qwen**: Enhances natural language processing capabilities
- **Llama 3.1**: Provides advanced reasoning and code generation
- **Custom System Prompt**: Tailors AI behavior for optimal coding assistance
- **shadcn/ui**: Offers accessible and customizable UI components
- **Next.js**: Supports seamless integration with React applications

## Getting Started

To start using Codio in your development workflow:

1. Visit [codio.fun](https://codio.fun) to create an account
2. Install the Codio CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g @codio/cli
   ```
3. Authenticate with your Codio account:
   ```
   codio auth login
   ```
4. Start a new Codio chat:
   ```
   codio chat
   ```

## Usage

### Components
Codio generates components using shadcn/ui. Refer to the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for detailed usage instructions.

### Links, Images, and Fonts
When working with Next.js projects, use the following components:
- [Next.js Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)
- [Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image)
- [Next.js Font](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

### Integrating Generated Code
Once Codio generates code, you can integrate it into your React application like any other component:

1. Copy the generated code
2. Paste it into a new file in your project
3. Import and use the component in your application

## Projects

Projects in Codio offer powerful organization and customization features:

1. **Chat Organization**: Group related chats for better management
2. **Custom Data Sources**: Upload your own data for Codio to reference
3. **Tailored Instructions**: Add specific guidelines to customize Codio's behavior

To create a new project:
```
codio project create
```

## Production Guidelines

Before deploying Codio-generated code to production, consider the following:

### Accessibility
- Test your UI with tools like axe and Lighthouse
- Leverage shadcn/ui's built-in accessibility features
- Manually test for additional accessibility improvements

### Security
- Regularly check for potential security issues
- Use tools like Snyk to identify and fix vulnerabilities

### Performance
- Optimize generated code for production environments
- Conduct thorough performance testing before deployment

## Roadmap

We're constantly working to improve Codio. Upcoming features include:

- Enhanced multi-language support
- Improved code refactoring capabilities
- Integration with popular IDEs
- Advanced project management features
